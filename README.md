# Generative AI for Synthetic Data: A Comprehensive Survey (2025)
### CMPE 255 — Short Story / Survey Assignment   
**Source Paper (Survey):** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08839

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains all deliverables for the CMPE 255 Short Story / Survey Assignment based on the 2025 arXiv survey paper **“Generative AI for Synthetic Data: A Comprehensive Survey.”**

Synthetic data has become an essential resource in modern data mining and machine learning. This project explores:
- Generative models used for synthetic data  
- Why synthetic data is useful  
- Evaluation metrics (fidelity, utility, privacy, diversity)  
- Real-world applications  
- Challenges and future directions  

All artifacts—slides, video, Medium article, and written survey—are included.
